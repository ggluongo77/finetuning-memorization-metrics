"Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg supports this Edison deal, and the business community supports some recent amendments. This likely mitigates concerns from other pro-business Democrats.  With or without the Shaver Lake provisions, Hertzberg should get at least 41 Democratic members (and probably a few more), but no more than 2 Republicans (if any) to vote Aye on the bill.  Hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus - he needs 41 votes for the bill to pass, and there are 50 Democrats in his caucus.  If the vote is close, a personal plea from him and/or the Governor should enable him to get to 41.

"I recently met Robert Bo Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron. "

But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

"1) I have had a couple discussions with Rod on the finance/accounting organization for Wind.  I understand that Adam is pushing for a new full-time CFO including a CFO for Europe.  Being open, Adam and I have different views on the direction of the organization.  My view is that many functions should be supported by the Enron infrastructure (including treasury, cash-management, insurance, IT, etc.).  Adam would prefer to stay autonomous and is attempting to direct initiatives to that end.  I continue to push the organization in the course that I believe makes most sense.  While we are both professionals, this situation does create a conflict.  In my opinion, the most serious issues in this business are not financial, they are operational and commercial.  I'll continue to work with Rod, but would be glad to discuss with you in further detail.

"By now, you must have heard of NETCO. This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.

This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

"In a word - no.  ENW budgets have already been submitted to Corp as well.  There are allocations from ENW to Corp for IT Infrastructure (primarily headcount driven) and IT Maintenance and Development, and I will be reviewing these with Rick Causey.  The largest portion of our ENW costs are allocated to EA, EGM, EIM, and EES.  It is these business units primarily with whom we are meeting to share the level of detail discussed in my memo.   These business units already have in hand an allocation billing for 2002 from ENW.  Our meetings at a greater level of detail may result in some changes to the ENW budget, as business units understand more detail around the cost structures for supporting certain lines of business and certain IT development costs.  When I explained our budgeting process to Rick Causey, he had suggested that I share that with everyone on the Management Committee.  Some members are more directly impacted the the ENW budget than others.  --Sally

"Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.
